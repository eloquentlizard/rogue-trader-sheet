# rogue-trader-sheet-improved-improved
rogue trader sheet for roll20, modified from a modified sheet

# Why?
The improved sheet under roguetradermago's original repo had some issues I'm aiming to correct, plus some formatting weirdness that was not displaying properly on some browsers.

Most of this is likely going to be for my own usage, but I wanted to have an archive of my edits in case of catastrophe.
