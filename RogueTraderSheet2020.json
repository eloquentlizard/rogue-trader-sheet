"instructions": "This sheet is designed for use in Roll20 to play the Warhammer 40k: Rogue Trader pen & paper RPG by Fantasy Flight Games.
Based on the Dark Heresy 2nd Edition Character Sheet created by Daniel D., Michael R and Samuel L. This version is a massive expansion of both functionality and style that does Not require API scripts.
Dice interpretation: Percentile dice rolls follow this basic formula (@{characteristic}+?{modifiers}-1d100cs1cf100)/10. 
The macro (inside the roll template) interprets any positive result as a success (including 0) any negative results are failures, the results are divided by 10 (by the macro)  to provide the *Degree(s) of Success (or failure)*. 
The results have decimal numbers, this is intentional (limitations of macros math functions), just ignore them.
Some fields auto calculate values based on the Characteristic Bonus value (the small box at the corner of the Characteristic number) remember to fill these fields accordingly.
Many fields and checkboxes across the sheet have information tooltips that show up when you point at them with the mouse cursor, very useful information there, check them out!. 
Many fields also include a white text area to copy and paste descriptions, these fields can be hidden/displayed with the corresponding checkbox, they can also be shown in the chat by clicking the "Show" button.
These fields can also include "inline rolls", in case there is a roll as a part of an item/talent effect.
The Inline rolls must always be written in between double square brackets "[[ dice ]]", these rolls will be seen on the chat when using the "Show" button.
If you want to create your own custom macros using this character sheet's roll template, use &{template:custom}, 
the first line uses {{name=}} the roll result line uses {{result=}} and the description field uses {{desc=}}, the other lines simply follow {{"insert title here" = "insert value here"}}.
The sheet is best displayed on the Roll20 supported browsers Chrome and Firefox, at 100% Zoom (no zoom basically) and inside the roll20 screen, althout it can be expanded or dislayed on an external window with no problems, most elements will strech-out to fill the screen without breaking.
